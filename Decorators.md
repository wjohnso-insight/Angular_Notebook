# Decorators

## *“Modules, components and services are classes that use decorators. These decorators mark their type and provide metadata that tells Angular how to use them.”*

For example:

```plaintext
The metadata for a component class associates it with a template that defines a view. A template combines ordinary HTML with Angular directives and binding markup that allow Angular to modify the HTML before rendering it for display.
```

```plaintext
The metadata for a service class provides the information Angular needs to make it available to components through dependency injection (DI).
```
